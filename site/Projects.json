The TSPO are used to organize and describe data within the iCity project, and may be used as means of publishing or sharing data with the research community. The TPSO resolves ambiguities and disagreements between terms by defining a common set of concepts that captures the domain, with agreed-upon definitions. The precise and formal nature of the ontology supports the use of services such as question-answering, inference, and data validation. Based on the definitions, we are able to infer new information that was not originally part of the knowledge base. Mapping data from different projects into the ontology identifies relationships which uncover synergies between the projects, thus illustrating how data from one project may serve to inform the work of another.",
